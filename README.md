vizkit3d: a lightweight infrastructure to build data display using C++, OpenSceneGraph and Qt

vizkit3d is a lightweight infrastructure to allow the creation of 3D views to display
data (and in particular data related to robotic sensing) live. It is used as the
core 3D view implementation in [Rock, the Robot Construction Kit](http://rock-robotics.org).
Nonetheless, vizkit3d uses only widely accepted libraries (Qt and OSG) and depends
on the Rock framework in no way.

Vizkit3D functionality can also be accessed from Ruby by using
[the vizkit library](https://github.com/rock-core/gui-vizkit).
